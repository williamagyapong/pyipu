    """
    Iterative Proportional Updating algorithm.
    
    A general case of iterative proportional fitting. It can satisfy
    two, disparate sets of marginals that do not agree on a single total. A
    common example is balancing population data using household- and person-level
    marginal controls. This could be for survey expansion or synthetic
    population creation. The second set of marginal/seed data is optional, meaning
    it can also be used for more basic IPF tasks.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    primary_seed : pandas.DataFrame
        In population synthesis or household survey expansion, 
        this would be the household seed table (each record would represent a 
        household). It could also be a trip table, where each row represents an 
        origin-destination pair.
    primary_targets : dict
        A dictionary of DataFrames. Each key in the dictionary defines a 
        marginal dimension and must match a column from the primary_seed table. 
        The DataFrame associated with each key can contain a geography field 
        (starting with "geo_"). If so, each row in the target table defines a 
        new geography (these could be TAZs, tracts, clusters, etc.). The other 
        column names define the marginal categories that targets are provided for.
    secondary_seed : pandas.DataFrame, optional
        Most commonly, if the primary_seed describes households, the secondary 
        seed table would describe the persons in each household. Must contain 
        the same primary_id column that links each person to their respective 
        household in primary_seed.
    secondary_targets : dict, optional
        Same format as primary_targets, but they constrain the secondary_seed table.
    primary_id : str, default="id"
        The field used to join the primary and secondary seed tables. Only 
        necessary if secondary_seed is provided.
    secondary_importance : float, default=1
        A value between 0 and 1 signifying the importance of the secondary targets. 
        At an importance of 1, the function will try to match the secondary targets 
        exactly. At 0, only the percentage distributions are used.
    relative_gap : float, default=0.01
        After each iteration, the weights are compared to the previous weights 
        and the %RMSE is calculated. If the %RMSE is less than the relative_gap 
        threshold, then the process terminates.
    max_iterations : int, default=100
        Maximum number of iterations to perform, even if relative_gap is not reached.
    absolute_diff : float, default=10
        Upon completion, the function will report the worst-performing marginal 
        category and geography based on the percent difference from the target. 
        absolute_diff is a threshold below which percent differences don't matter.
        
        For example, if a target value was 2, and the expanded weights equaled 1, 
        that's a 100% difference, but is not important because the absolute value
        is only 1.
    weight_floor : float, default=0.00001
        Minimum weight to allow in any cell to prevent zero weights. Should be 
        arbitrarily small compared to your seed table weights.
    verbose : bool, default=False
        Print iteration details and worst marginal stats upon completion?
    max_ratio : float, default=10000
        The average weight per seed record is calculated by dividing the total 
        of the targets by the number of records. The max_ratio caps the maximum 
        weight at a multiple of that average.
    min_ratio : float, default=0.0001
        The average weight per seed record is calculated by dividing the total 
        of the targets by the number of records. The min_ratio caps the minimum 
        weight at a multiple of that average.
        
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with the following keys:
        - weight_tbl: The primary_seed with weight, avg_weight, and weight_factor columns
        - weight_dist: A matplotlib figure showing the weight distribution
        - primary_comp: A DataFrame comparing the primary seed results to targets
        - secondary_comp: A DataFrame comparing the secondary seed results to targets
          (only if secondary_seed is provided)
